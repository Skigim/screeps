# üèõÔ∏è OPERATION FOUNDATIONS - HARDENED FOR PARALLEL EXECUTION

## Briefing Documents Status: ‚úÖ HARDENED

The briefings have been fortified with explicit coordination protocols for simultaneous agent deployment.

---

## üìã DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Launching Agents:

- [x] All briefing documents created and hardened
- [x] `CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md` coordination hub ready
- [x] `AGENT_COORDINATION_RULES.md` created with explicit rules
- [x] `.gitignore` verified
- [ ] **Human Commander**: Review all briefings
- [ ] **Human Commander**: Deploy Agent Primus
- [ ] **Human Commander**: Deploy Agent Secundus  
- [ ] **Human Commander**: Deploy Agent Tertius

---

## üõ°Ô∏è HARDENING MEASURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Explicit Phase Gates**
Each agent now has clear STOP points:
- Agent Primus: Stops after Phase I, waits for Secundus
- Agent Secundus: Signals completion clearly after each phase
- Agent Tertius: Blocked until Secundus completes, then proceeds

### 2. **File Ownership Rules**
`AGENT_COORDINATION_RULES.md` defines exclusive file ownership:
- No agent may modify another agent's files
- Clear boundaries prevent merge conflicts
- Single shared file: `CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md` (append-only)

### 3. **Mandatory Status Updates**
Each agent MUST update `CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md` after every phase with:
- Timestamp
- Phase completion status
- Explicit signals ("PHASE II COMPLETE")
- Files modified
- Next action or blocker

### 4. **Dependency Verification**
Agents must check `CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md` before proceeding:
- Agent Tertius checks for "Agent Secundus Phase II COMPLETE"
- Agent Primus Phase II checks for "Agent Secundus Phase II COMPLETE"
- Agent Primus Phase III checks for "Agent Tertius ALL MAGISTRATES COMPLETE"

### 5. **Testing Requirements**
All agents must run `npm run build` after each phase completion before signaling done.

### 6. **Clear Communication Protocol**
Standardized dispatch format with explicit signals prevents ambiguity.

## üéØ EXPECTED EXECUTION TIMELINE

### Wave 1: All Agents Deploy Simultaneously
- **Agent Primus**: Starts Phase I immediately (build tooling)
- **Agent Secundus**: Starts Phase I immediately (interfaces)
- **Agent Tertius**: Updates status to "WAITING", monitors for Secundus

### Wave 2: After ~5-10 minutes
- **Agent Primus**: Completes Phase I, signals, WAITS
- **Agent Secundus**: Completes Phase I, moves to Phase II
- **Agent Tertius**: Still waiting, monitoring

### Wave 3: After ~15-20 minutes
- **Agent Secundus**: Completes Phase II, signals "PHASE II COMPLETE"
- **Agent Primus**: Sees signal, begins Phase II
- **Agent Tertius**: Sees signal, begins Phase I

### Wave 4: After ~30-40 minutes
- **Agent Primus**: Completes Phase II, WAITS for Tertius
- **Agent Tertius**: Working through Magistrate implementations

### Wave 5: After ~50-60 minutes
- **Agent Tertius**: Completes all phases, signals "ALL MAGISTRATES COMPLETE"
- **Agent Primus**: Sees signal, begins Phase III integration

### Wave 6: Mission Complete
- **Agent Primus**: Completes Phase III, final build test
- **All Agents**: Signal mission complete
- **Build**: `npm run build` succeeds, `dist/main.js` exists

## üìä MONITORING DASHBOARD

As Strategic Coordinator, watch for these signals in `CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md`:

### Critical Path Milestones:
1. ‚úÖ "Agent Secundus Phase I COMPLETE"
2. ‚úÖ "Agent Secundus Phase II COMPLETE" ‚Üê **CRITICAL BLOCKER RELEASE**
3. ‚úÖ "Agent Tertius ALL MAGISTRATES COMPLETE" ‚Üê **FINAL BLOCKER RELEASE**
4. ‚úÖ "Agent Primus Phase III COMPLETE"
5. ‚úÖ "npm run build SUCCESS"

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent modifying files outside their ownership
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent proceeding past phase gate without dependency satisfied
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Compilation errors reported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Agents not updating `CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ambiguous status signals

---

## üö® INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS

If you observe:

### Agent Jumping Phase Gates:
```
Response: "HALT. Check CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md for [dependency]. Do not proceed until [signal] appears."
```

### File Conflict:
```
Response: "CONFLICT DETECTED. Agent [X] owns [file]. Agent [Y] must revert changes. Refer to AGENT_COORDINATION_RULES.md."
```

### Build Failure:
```
Response: "Build failed. Agent [X], review your changes in [file]. Test locally before signaling completion."
```

### Ambiguous Status:
```
Response: "Status unclear. Use explicit signal format: 'Agent [X] Phase [Y] COMPLETE'. Update CAMPAIGN_STATUS.md."
```

## ‚úÖ FINAL PRE-LAUNCH VERIFICATION

Imperator, verify before launching agents:

- [x] All briefings hardened for parallel execution
- [x] Coordination rules documented
- [x] Phase gates clearly defined
- [x] File ownership boundaries established
- [x] Status update protocol standardized
- [x] Dependency chains explicit
- [x] Testing requirements clear
- [ ] **READY TO DEPLOY AGENTS**
