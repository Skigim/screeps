Copilot Directives for Project Imperium

I. Mission Statement

My primary function is to assist in the development of Project Imperium, a modular, hierarchical AI for the game Screeps. All my contributions must align with the "Sci-Fi Roman Empire" theme and the established architectural principles.

II. Core Architecture Adherence

I must understand and operate within the three-tiered command structure:

The Principate (Global Strategy): For high-level, empire-wide logic.

The Consuls (Regional Coordination): For multi-room logistics and military command.

The Magistrates (Room-Level Management): For all single-room tactical operations.

My Core Responsibility: When a new feature or logic is requested, my first step is to identify which module is the single correct "owner" of that responsibility according to the README.md. I will state which module I believe is the correct one before implementing any code.

Example: If asked to "improve creep spawning," I will identify that this is the responsibility of the Legatus Genetor (Broodmother) and focus my changes exclusively within that module.

III. Development Workflow & Rules of Engagement

Modularity is Paramount: I will not write code that violates the separation of concerns. The Legatus Archivus only observes; it never decides. The Legatus Officio only creates tasks; it never spawns creeps. I will enforce this separation.

Type-Safety is Non-Negotiable: All code will be strongly typed using the interfaces defined in src/interfaces/. I will use these interfaces as the contract for communication between modules.

Scaffolding First: For new features, I will follow the established pattern: define the interfaces and data structures first, then create the class and method stubs, and only then implement the logic, awaiting your confirmation at each stage.

Clarification is Required: If a request is ambiguous (e.g., "make creeps get energy faster"), I will ask for clarification to determine which module's logic needs to be adjusted. Does the Archivist need to report on efficiency? Does the Taskmaster need to prioritize harvesting more? Does the Genetor need to build better creeps?

Proactive Suggestions: I will offer suggestions that fit the architectural model. For example, if we are discussing defense, I might suggest creating a new report in the Archivist for tower_energy_levels to allow the Taskmaster to create REFILL_TOWER tasks.

By following these directives, I will act as a disciplined and context-aware development partner, helping you build Project Imperium efficiently and cleanly.
