# 🎯 PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## ✅ Build Verification
- [x] `npm run build` succeeds
- [x] `dist/main.js` generated (58,581 bytes)
- [x] Zero TypeScript errors
- [x] Zero compilation warnings

## ✅ Deployment Configuration
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- [x] YAML config template created (`.screepsrc.yaml`)
- [x] Deployment guide created (`DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- [x] `.gitignore` updated to protect credentials
- [x] Sample JSON config available (`screeps.sample.json`)

## 📋 Choose Your Deployment Method

### Option A: GitHub Actions (Automated)
- [ ] Repository pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Add `SCREEPS_TOKEN` to repository secrets
- [ ] (Optional) Add `SCREEPS_BRANCH` secret
- [ ] Push to `main` branch or trigger workflow manually

### Option B: Manual npm Deployment
- [ ] Copy `screeps.sample.json` to `screeps.json`
- [ ] Edit `screeps.json` with your credentials
- [ ] Run `npm run deploy`

### Option C: screeps-api CLI (Recommended for Development)
- [ ] Install: `npm install -g screeps-api`
- [ ] Edit `.screepsrc.yaml` with your credentials
- [ ] Run: `screeps deploy`

## 🎮 First Deployment Steps

### 1. Test Locally First (Recommended)
- [ ] Install local Screeps server or use Steam version
- [ ] Deploy to local server (http://localhost:21025)
- [ ] Observe first 100 ticks
- [ ] Verify basic functionality

### 2. Monitor Initial Deployment
- [ ] Open Screeps console
- [ ] Watch for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verify creeps spawn
- [ ] Verify tasks generate
- [ ] Verify creeps execute tasks
- [ ] Monitor energy flow

### 3. Key Metrics to Watch
- [ ] Creeps spawning successfully
- [ ] Energy harvesting from sources
- [ ] Energy delivered to spawns
- [ ] Controller being upgraded
- [ ] Construction happening (if sites exist)
- [ ] No idle creeps when tasks available

## 🔍 Debugging First Run

If issues occur, check:
- [ ] Console for error messages
- [ ] Task generation (LegatusOfficio)
- [ ] Executor factory registration
- [ ] Creep memory assignments
- [ ] Target positions valid

## 📊 Success Indicators

After first 50-100 ticks, you should see:
- ✅ Steady creep population
- ✅ Energy flowing: sources → spawns → controller
- ✅ Controller upgrade happening continuously
- ✅ Room Control Level increasing
- ✅ Spawns maintaining energy reserves

## 🎺 Ready for Deployment!

All systems operational. Choose your deployment method and conquer! ⚔️
